# NSIS-Walker
#<pre><p>
Do you use NSIS2 to write installers?  No more writing install and uninstall
lists by hand, this tool was created to make your job easier.

The app walker will create output to be used in .nsh includes for the NSIS
(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System).  The .nsh files can then be included
in the install and un-install sections.

The NSIS Walker is expalined in detail, with screen shots on the nsis sourceforge wiki
